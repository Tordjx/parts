# Hollow knee

## Revisions

### 2023/03/16

- Enlarge M3 screw head hole diameters by +0.3 mm
- We print vertically now, so the holes are tighter than before.

### 2023/03/08

- Adapt back shape to qdd100 beta 3

### 2022/05/22

- Fix the missing top screws!
- Flatten the bone-knee contact surface
- Flatten bottom as well

### 2022/05/21

- Widen hex hole to 28 + 0.6 mm ($0.3 \sqrt{3}/2$ mm tolerance / edge)
- Because we don't want to hammer parts in while connected to the actuator.
- Note the $\sqrt{3}/2$ factor to convert from diameter to edge tolerance!

### 2022/05/07

- Switch to M3x8 screws: 3 mm in part, 5 mm in heat-set insert
- Increase hex dimensions from 28 + 0.2 mm to 28 + 0.3 mm
- Hollow hex part is exactly 60 mm to match the bone
- ... followed by a 28 + 0.3 mm full cylinder for positioning (removes the excess material that prevented full insertion of the hex in v5)

### 2022/05/04

- Use M4x10 screws: 4 mm in part + 6 mm inside heat-set insert
