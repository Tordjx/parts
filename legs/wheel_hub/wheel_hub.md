Wheel Hub

## Revisions

### 2024/11/07
- Made the wheel and wheel hub a single piece. Added an outer lip to keep the tire in place.

### 2023/04/11
- Add a flange at the base of the shaft, to distribute torsion effort from the flat part of the screw to the 'cone' via the flange. (and don't rely only on the 'fragile' shaft).
- Add a chamfer to tip the of the shaft, to prevent it from deforming and locking the nut when pushing the hub out of the wheel.
- Shorten the shaft, so the user pushes on the nut (instead of the shaft) to get the hub out of the wheel.
- Include a tool to increase the resistance of the shaft when holding it in a drill. (Useful if the outside diameter of the hub needs to be decreased)
